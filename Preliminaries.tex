We consider the usual Hilbert finite normed vector space $(\R^n,\ell_2)$, $n \in \mathbb{N}_{> 0}$, $\ell_2$ the classical euclidean norm. We denote a unit ball in $\R^n$ with $\ball$ and unit sphere in $\R^n$ of radius $r$ as $\sphere$. We only denote the radius $r$ explicitly as in $\ball_r$ and $\sphere_r$, when $r$ is different than $1$. We denote by $\proj_{\sphere}$ the (convex) projector on $\sphere$. We denote the set of real symmetric matrices of size $n$ by $\calS^n(\R)$, and the set of linear functions in $\R^n$ by $\mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. We denote the ellipsoid described by the matrix $P \in \mathbb{S}^n$ as $E_P$. We denote the homothety of ratio $\lambda$ by $\calH_{\lambda}$.

We denote by $M$ the set $\{1,2,\dots,m\}$, ($m \in \N_{>0}$) and consider a switched linear system of modes $\calM = \{A_1, A_2,\dots, A_m\} \subset \R^{n \times n}$ indexed by $M$. We observe the system: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dynamicalsystem}x_{k+1} = A_{\sigma(k)}x_k,
\end{equation}
where, $x_k \in \R^n$, k is index of time and $\sigma: \N \to M$ is the switching sequence. Let $y_k := x_{k+1}$. 
We assume that we only know the number of modes $m$, the input $x_k$ and the output $y_k$ at each time $k$. We ignore what are the matrices and the index of the matrix which is applied at every time. We consider the following problem.
