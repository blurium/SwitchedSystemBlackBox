\begin{theorem}
Consider a black-box switching system and $N$ samples of its dynamics as in \eqref{eq:triples}. Consider the optimal solution $(\lambda^*,P)$ which minimizes $\lambda$ in \eqref{eq:lowerbound}. For any factor $1<\delta,$ one can compute the level of confidence $\beta$ such that $\rho<\delta\cdot\lambda^*.$ 
% denote $\gamma(P,\epsilon)$ the largest $\gamma$ such that $\gamma^2y_i^TPy_i\leq x_i^TPx_i$
