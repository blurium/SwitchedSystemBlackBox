A switched linear system is in the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:switchedSystem}x_{k+1} = A_{\sigma(k)}x_k,\end{equation}
where, $\sigma: \N \to M$ is the switching sequence where $|M| = m$ and $A_{\sigma(k)} \in \calM$, for all $\sigma$ and $k$.There are two important properties of switched systems that we exploit in this paper.
\begin{property}\label{property:homogeneity}
Let $\xi(x, k)$ denote the state of the system \eqref{eq:switchedSystem} at time $k$, starting from the initial condition $x$. The dynamical system \eqref{eq:switchedSystem} is a homogeneous:
$$\xi(\gamma x, k)= \gamma \xi(x, k). $$
\end{property}
\begin{property}\label{property:convpres}
The dynamics given in \eqref{eq:switchedSystem} is convexity-preserving, meaning that for any set of points $X \subseteq \R^n$ we have:
$$ f(\conv{X})\subset \conv\{f(X)\}. $$
\end{property}

To make our reasoning clearer, we introduce the \emph{Lyapunov exponent} of the system, which is a numerical quantity describing its stability.
\begin{definition}   Given a dynamical system as in \eqref{eq:dynamicalsystem} its \emph{Lyapunov exponent} is given by
$$\rho =\inf{\{r:\,\forall x_0, \exists C\in \re^+: \quad x(0)=x_0 \Rightarrow x(t)\leq Cr^t\}}. $$
\end{definition}
Under certain conditions, deciding stability amounts to decide whether $\rho<1.$  In order to understand the quality of our techniques, we will actually try to prove lower and upper bounds on $\rho.$ 

In the case of switched linear systems, the Lyapunov exponent is known as the Joint Spectral Radius of the set of matrices, which can be alternatively defined as follows:
\begin{definition} \cite{jungers_lncis} Given a set of matrices $\cM \subset \re^{n\times n},$ its \emph{joint spectral radius} (JSR) is given by
$$\rho(\cM) =\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} \max_{i_1,\dots, i_t}\{||A_{i_1} \dots A_{i_t}||^{1/t}: A_i\in\cM\}. $$
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:scaling}
 Note that one can scale the problem because the JSR is homogeneous:
$$\rho(\cM/\gamma)=\rho(\cM)/\gamma, \forall \lambda>0, $$ and $\cM/\lambda$ can be studied by studying the scaled inputs $$(x_t, y_t/\gamma,\sigma(t)).$$
\end{remark}
