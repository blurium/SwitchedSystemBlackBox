In this section, we show that using the Property \ref{property:convpres} and Property \ref{property:homogeneity}, by sampling finitely many points on a level set of a candidate CQLF, we can compute an upper bound on $\rho$. This section formalizes this discussion. Before preceding to the main theorem, we motivate the upcoming technical discussion by stating the following theorem to which most of this section is devoted.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:mainTheorem0} Let $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. For a given a sampling of the switched linear system \eqref{eq:switchedSystem}, $\omega_N$ and $\beta \in [0,1)$. We can compute $\delta(\beta, \omega_N) < \infty$ such that for any set $Z_P$ such that $\sigma_P(Z_P) = \epsilon$ :
\begin{equation}E_{\delta^2P} \subset  \convhull (E_P \setminus Z_P),\, \text{with probability $\beta$},
\end{equation}
for some $P \succ 0$.
\end{theorem}
Once Theorem \ref{thm:mainTheorem0} established the main result of this section follows.
\begin{theorem}[Main Theorem] \label{thm:mainTheorem} For a given a sampling of the switched linear system \eqref{eq:switchedSystem}, $\omega_N$, where $N \geq \frac{n(n+1)}{2}+1$ and $\beta \in [0,1)$, we can compute $\delta(\beta, \omega_N) < \infty$ such that with probability at least $\beta$, $\rho \leq \frac{\gamma^*(\omega_N)}{\delta}$. Moreover, $\lim_{N \to \infty} \delta(N) = 1$.
\end{theorem}
%\begin{theorem}
%Consider a black-box switching system and $N$ samples of its dynamics as in \eqref{eq:switchedSystem}. Consider the optimal solution $(\lambda^*,P)$ which minimizes $\lambda$ in \eqref{eq:lowerbound}. For any factor $1<\delta,$ one can compute the level of confidence $\beta$ such that $\rho<\delta\cdot\lambda^*.$ 
%% denote $\gamma(P,\epsilon)$ the largest $\gamma$ such that $\gamma^2y_i^TPy_i\leq x_i^TPx_i$ 
%\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}Let $\omega_N = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N\}$. Note that, by definition of $\gamma^*$ we have:
\begin{equation*} y_i^TPy_i \leq \gamma^* x_i^TPx_i, \quad \forall\, x_i \in \omega_N, A \in \calM,\end{equation*}
for some $P \succ 0$. Then by Property \ref{property:convpres}

Since have
$$ E_{\delta^2P} \subset  \convhull (E_P\setminus S_\epsilon),$$ with probability $\beta$, by the and so
$$
(\cM/\delta \lambda^*) \convhull (E_P \setminus S_\epsilon) \subset \convhull (E_P\setminus S_\epsilon).$$

Then, $\delta\lambda$ is un upper bound on $\rho,$ with a confidence $\beta.$ 
\end{proof}
