We start by computing a lower bound for $\rho$ which is based on the following theorem from the switched linear systems literature.
\begin{theorem}\cite[Theorem 2.11]{jungers_lncis}\label{thm:john}
For any bounded set of matrices such that $\rho(\cM)<\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},$ there exists a Common Quadratic Lyapunov Function (CQLF) for $\cM,$ that is, a $P\succ 0$ such that: $$\forall A\in \cM,\, A^TPA\preceq P. $$
\end{theorem}

CQLFs are useful because they can be computed (if they exist) with Semidefinite Programming (see \cite{boyd}), and they constitute a stability guarantee for the switched system as the following theorem formalizes:
\begin{theorem}\cite[Prop. 2.8]{jungers_lncis}\label{thm:cqlf} Consider a bounded set of matrices $\cM$. If there exists a $\gamma \geq 0$ and $P \succ 0$ such that $$\forall\, A \in \calM, A^TPA \preceq \gamma^2P,$$ then $\rho(\cM) \leq \gamma$.
\end{theorem}
Note that smaller the $\gamma$ is, the tighter bound we get on $\rho(\cM)$. Therefore, in particular to bound $\rho$ we can consider the optimal solution $\gamma^*$ of the following optimization problem:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:campiOpt0}
\begin{aligned}
& \text{min}_{\gamma, P} & & \gamma \\
& \text{s.t.} 
&  & (Ax)^TP(Ax) \leq \gamma^2 x^TPx,\,\forall A \in \calM, \,\forall\, x \in \sphere,\\
& && P \succ 0. \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where we were able to replace the condition $\forall\,x \in \R^n$ with $\,\forall\, x \in \sphere$, where $\sphere$ is the unit sphere. This is thanks to the Property \ref{property:homogeneity} which implies that it is sufficient to show that a CQLF is decreasing on a set enclosing the origin, e.g. the unit sphere. 

Even though an upper bound is more difficult to obtain in the black box model where only a finite number of observations are available, in this section we leverage Theorem 3.1 in order to derive an easy lower bound in our setting.

The following theorem shows that the existence of a CQLF for \eqref{eq:switchedSystem} can be checked by considering $N$ pairs $(x_i, j_i) \in \R^n \times M$, where $i \in \{1, \ldots N\}.$ Recall that in our setting, we assume that we observe pairs of the form $(x_t,x_{t+1}),$ but we do not observe the mode applied to the system during this time step.
%The existence of a CQLF for our (potentially scaled) blackbox system is certainly something we can check: after collecting $N$ observations, one can solve the following optimization problem efficiently. 
%

%Indeed, when $\lambda $ is fixed, the problem is a set of LMIs, and $\lambda $ can be optimized by bisection.
\begin{theorem}
For a given uniform sampling: $$\omega_N := \{(x_1, j_1), (x_2, j_2), \ldots, (x_N, j_N)\} \subset \R^n \times M,$$ and let $S_{\omega_N}=\{(x_1,y_1),...,(x_N,y_N)\}$ be the corresponding observations available, satisfying $$y_i= A_{j_i}x_i\,\, \forall (x_i, y_i) \in S_{\omega_N}.$$Also let $\gamma^*(\omega_N)$ be the optimal solution of the following optimization problem:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lowerbound}
\begin{aligned}
& \text{min}_P & & \gamma \\
& \text{s.t.} 
&  & (y_i)^T P (y_i) \leq \gamma^2 x_i^TPx_i,\,  \forall \,i :1\leq i \leq N.\\
& && P \succ 0 \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Then, we have:
$$\rho(\cM) \geq \frac{\gamma^*(\omega_N)}{\sqrt{n}}.$$ Note that, \eqref{eq:lowerbound} can be efficiently solved by semidefinite programming and bisection on gamma \cite{boyd}.

\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By definition of $\gamma^*$, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists no matrix $P \in \calS^n_{++}$ such that:
\begin{equation*}(y_i)^T P (y_i) \leq (\gamma^*(\omega_N) -\epsilon)^2 x_i^TPx_i,\,  \forall \,i :1\leq i \leq N.
\end{equation*}
By using Remark \ref{rem:scaling} this means that, there exists no CQLF for the scaled set of matrices $\frac{\cM}{(\gamma^*(\omega_N)-\epsilon)}$. By Theorem \ref{thm:john} this leads to:
\begin{equation*}\frac{\rho(\cM)}{\gamma^*(\omega_N)} \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}.\end{equation*}
\end{proof}
