We consider the usual finite normed vector space $(\R^n,\ell_2)$, $n \in \mathbb{N}_{> 0}$, with $\ell_2$ the classical Euclidean norm. We denote the set of linear functions in $\R^n$ by $\mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and the set of real symmetric matrices of size $n$ by $\calS^n$. In particular, the set of positive definite matrices is denoted by $\calS^n_{++}$. We write $P \succ 0$ to state that $P$ is positive definite, and $P \succeq 0$ to state that $P$ is positive semi-definite. Given a set $X \subset \R^n$, and $r \in \R_{> 0}$ we write \mbox{$rX := \{x \in X : rx\}$} to denote the scaling of ratio $r$ of this set. We denote by $\ball$ (respectively $\sphere$) the ball (respectively sphere) of unit radius centered at the origin.  We denote the ellipsoid described by the matrix $P \in \calS^n_{++}$ as $E_P$, i.e., $E_P:= \{x \in \R^n: x^TPx = 1\}$. Finally, we denote the spherical projector on $\sphere$ by $\proj_{\sphere} := x/\Vert x\Vert$. %We denote the homothety of ratio $r$ by $\calH_{r}$. 
%We denote by $\wp(M)$ the power set of $M$.

%We denote by $M$ the set $\{1,2,\dots,m\}$, ($m \in \N_{>0}$) and consider a switched linear system of modes $\calM = \{A_1, A_2,\dots, A_m\} \subset \R^{n \times n}$ indexed by $M$. We observe the system: 
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:dynamicalsystem}x_{k+1} = A_{\sigma(k)}x_k,
%\end{equation}
%where, $x_k \in \R^n$, k is index of time and $\sigma: \N \to M$ is the switching sequence. Let $y_k := x_{k+1}$. 
%We assume that we only know the number of modes $m$, the input $x_k$ and the output $y_k$ at each time $k$. We ignore what are the matrices and the index of the matrix which is applied at every time. We consider the following problem.

%For an ellipsoid centered at the origin, and for any of its subsets $\calA$, the \emph{sector} defined by $\calA$ is the subset $$\{t \calA, \ t \in [0,1]\} \subset\ \R^n.$$ We denote by $E_P^{\calA}$ the sector induced by $\calA \subset E_P$. In the particular case of the unit sphere, we instead write $\sphere^{\calA}$. We can notice that $E_P^{E_P}$ is the volume in $\R^n$ defined by $E_P$: $E_P^{E_P} = \{x \in \R^n: x^TPx \leq 1\}$.

\noindent
We consider in this work the classical uniform spherical measure on $\sphere$, denoted by $\sigma^{n-1}$, and derived from the Lebesgue measure $\lambda$ (see the appendix for precise definitions). For $m \in \N_{>0}$, we denote by $M$ the set $M=\{1,2, \ldots,m \}$ and we provide it with the uniform measure $\mu_M$. Finally, we define $Z = \sphere \times M$ as the Cartesian product of the unit sphere $\sphere$ and $M$. On this set, we define the product measure $\mu = \sigma^{n-1} \otimes \mu_M$. Note that, $\mu$ is a uniform measure on $Z$ and $\mu(Z)=1$.  


%We have $\mathcal{B}_{\sphere}$ defined by $\calA \in \mathcal{B}_{\sphere}$ if and only if $\sphere^{\calA} \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}^n}$. The spherical measure $\sigma^{n-1}$ is defined by
%$$\forall\ \calA \in \mathcal{B}_{\sphere},\, \sigma(\calA) = \frac{\lambda(\sphere^{\calA})}{\lambda(\ball)}. $$
%In other words, the spherical measure of a subset of the sphere is related to the Lebesgue measure of the sector of the unit ball it induces. Notice that $\sigma^{n-1}(\sphere) = 1$.
%Since $P \in \calS_{++}^n$, it can be written in its Choleski form \begin{equation}\label{choleski}P = L^TL,\end{equation} where $L$ is an upper triangular matrix. Note that, $L^{-1}$ maps the elements of $\sphere$ to $E_P$. Then, we define the measure on the ellipsoid $\sigma_P$ on the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}_{E_P}:=L^{-1}\mathcal{B}_\sphere$, where $\forall\, \calA \in \mathcal{B}_{E_P},\, \sigma_P({\calA}) = \sigma^{n-1}(L\calA)$.

%
%We now relate $\sigma^{n-1}(V_{\sphere})$ to $\sigma_P(E')$. Consider the transformation linear transformation $L \in \calL({\R^n})$ mapping $\sphere$ to $E_P$. Note that since $P \in \calS^n$, it can be written in its Choleski form $P = U D U^{-1}$, with $D$ diagonal matrix of its eigenvalues, and $U \in O_n$. Then, $L = P^{1/2}=U D^{1/2} U^{-1}$ where $D^{1/2}$ is the diagonal matrix comprised of square root of elements of $D$.
