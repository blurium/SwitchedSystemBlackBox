\begin{section}{Precisions on measures definitions}

For an ellipsoid centered at the origin, and for any of its subsets $\calA$, the \emph{sector} defined by $\calA$ is the subset $$\{t \calA, \ t \in [0,1]\} \subset\ \R^n.$$ We denote by $E_P^{\calA}$ the sector induced by $\calA \subset E_P$. In the particular case of the unit sphere, we instead write $\sphere^{\calA}$. We can notice that $E_P^{E_P}$ is the volume in $\R^n$ defined by $E_P$: $E_P^{E_P} = \{x \in \R^n: x^TPx \leq 1\}$.

The spherical Borelian $\sigma$-algebra, denoted by $\mathcal{B}_{\sphere}$, is defined by $$\calA \in \mathcal{B}_{\sphere} \iff \sphere^{\calA} \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}^n}.$$ We provide $(\sphere,\mathcal{B}_{\sphere})$ with the classical, unsigned and finite uniform spherical measure $\sigma^{n-1}$ defined by
$$\forall\ \calA \in \mathcal{B}_{\sphere},\, \sigma(\calA) = \frac{\lambda(\sphere^{\calA})}{\lambda(\ball)}. $$
In other words, the spherical measure of a subset of the sphere is related to the Lebesgue measure of the sector of the unit ball it induces. Notice that $\sigma^{n-1}(\sphere) = 1$.

Since $P \in \calS_{++}^n$, we recall that it can be written in its Choleski form \eqref{choleski}. Note that, $L^{-1}$ maps the elements of $\sphere$ to $E_P$. Then, we define the measure on the ellipsoid $\sigma_P$ on the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}_{E_P}:=L^{-1}\mathcal{B}_\sphere$, where $\forall\, \calA \in \mathcal{B}_{E_P},\, \sigma_P({\calA}) = \sigma^{n-1}(L\calA)$. 

Set $M$ is provided with the classical $\sigma$-algebra associated to the finite sets: $\Sigma_M = \wp(M)$, where $\wp(M)$ is the set of subsets of $M$. We provide $(M, \Sigma_M)$ with the uniform measure $\mu_M$. Similarly, we define $\Sigma_{M^l}$ as the product $\bigotimes^l \Sigma_M$ (which is here equal to $\wp(M)^l$), and we provide $(M^l, \Sigma_{M^l})$ with the uniform product measure $\mu_{M^l} = \otimes^l \mu_M$.

We can now denote the product $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}_{\sphere} \bigotimes (\Sigma_{M^l})$ generated by $\mathcal{B}_{\sphere}$ and $\Sigma_{M^l}$: $\Sigma = \sigma( \pi_{\sphere}^{-1}(\mathcal{B}_{\sphere}),  \pi_{M^l}^{-1}(\Sigma_{M^l}))$, where $\pi_{\sphere}: Z_l \to \sphere$ and $\pi_{M^l}: Z_l \to M^l$ are the standard projections. On $(Z_l,\mathcal{B}_{\sphere} \bigotimes (\Sigma_{M^l}) )$, we define the product measure $\mu_l = \sigma^{n-1} \otimes \mu_{M^l}$. Note that, $\mu_l$ is a uniform measure on $Z_l$ and $\mu_l(Z_l)=1$.
