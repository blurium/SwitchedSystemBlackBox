%We start by computing a lower bound for $\rho$ which is based on the following theorem from the switched linear systems literature.

%\begin{theorem}\cite[Theorem 2.11]{jungers_lncis}\label{thm:john}
%For any finite set of matrices such that $\rho(\cM)<\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},$ there exists a Common Quadratic Lyapunov Function (CQLF) for $\cM,$ that is, a $P\succ 0$ such that: $$\forall\ A\in \cM,\, A^TPA\preceq P. $$
%\end{theorem}
%
%CQLFs are useful because they can be computed (if they exist) with semidefinite programming (see \cite{boyd}), and they constitute a stability guarantee for switched systems as we formalize next.\begin{theorem}\cite[Prop. 2.8]{jungers_lncis}\label{thm:cqlf} Consider a finite set of matrices $\cM$. If there exist a $\gamma \geq 0$ and $P \succ 0$ such that $$\forall\ A \in \calM, A^TPA \preceq \gamma^2P,$$ then $\rho(\cM) \leq \gamma$.
%\end{theorem}
%
%
%Note that the smaller $\gamma$ is, the tighter is the upper bound we get on $\rho(\cM)$. Therefore, we can consider, in particular, the optimal solution $\gamma^*$ of the following optimization problem:
%\begin{equation}\label{eqn:campiOpt0}
%\begin{aligned}
%& \text{min}_{\gamma, P} & & \gamma \\
%& \text{s.t.} 
%&  & (Ax)^TP(Ax) \leq \gamma^2 x^TPx,\,\forall\ A \in \calM, \,\forall\, x \in \R^n,\\
%& && P \succ 0. \\
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%%where we were able to replace the condition $\forall\,x \in \R^n$ with $\,\forall\, x \in \sphere$, where $\sphere$ is the unit sphere. This is thanks to the Property \ref{property:homogeneity} which implies that it is sufficient to show that a CQLF is decreasing on a set enclosing the origin, e.g. the unit sphere. 
%
%Even though this upper bound is more difficult to obtain in a black-box setting where only a finite number of observations are available, in this section we leverage Theorem \ref{thm:john} in order to derive a straightforward lower bound.
%
%\rmj{The two theorems above provide us with a \emph{converse Lyapunov result:} if there exists a CQLF, then our system is stable.  If, on the contrary, there is no such stability guarantee, one may conclude a lower bound on the JSR. By combining these two results, one obtains an approximation algorithm for the JSR: the upper bound $\gamma^*$ obtained above is within an error factor of $1/\sqrt(n)$ of the true value.  It turns out that one can still refine this technique, in order to improve the error factor, and asymptotically get rid of it.  This is a well known technique for the `white-box' computation of the JSR, which we summarize in the following corollary:
% \begin{corollary}\label{cor:approx-products}
%For any finite set of matrices such that $\rho(\cM)<\frac{1}{\sqrt[2l]{n}},$ there exists a Common Quadratic Lyapunov Function (CQLF) for $$\cM^l:=\{A_{i_1},\dots, A_{i_{l}}:A_i\in\cM\},$$ that is, a $P\succ 0$ such that: $$\forall\ A\in \cM^l,\, A^TPA\preceq P. $$
%\end{corollary}
%\begin{proof}
%It is easy to see from the definition of the JSR that $$\rho(\cM^l)=\rho(\cM)^l.$$ Thus, applying Theorem \ref{thm:john} to $\cM^l,$ one directly obtains the corollary.
%\end{proof}

%%%%%We are now able to proceed with the main result of this section, which leverages the fact that necessary conditions for} the existence of a CQLF for \eqref{eq:switchedSystem} can be \rmj{obtained by considering a finite number of pairs $(x_i, x_{i+l}) \in \R^n .$} Recall that in our setting, we assume that we observe pairs of the form $(x_k,x_{k+1})$ \rmj{(or $(x_k,x_{k+l})$ for some $l\in \N$)} but we do not observe the mode applied to the system during this time step.

%The existence of a CQLF for our (potentially scaled) blackbox system is certainly something we can check: after collecting $N$ observations, one can solve the following optimization problem efficiently. 
%

%Indeed, when $\lambda $ is fixed, the problem is a set of LMIs, and $\lambda $ can be optimized by bisection.

In this section, we start by providing a theorem for a deterministic lower bound based on the observations $W_{\omega_N}$, whose accuracy depends on the ``horizon'' $l$.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:lowerbound}
For an arbitrary $l \in \N,$ and a given uniform sample $$\omega_N := \{(x_1, j_{1,1},\dots,j_{1,l}), (x_2, j_{2,1},\dots,j_{2,l}), \ldots, (x_N, j_{N,1},\dots,j_{N,l})\} \subset Z_l,$$ 
by considering $\gamma^*(\omega_N)$ the optimal solution of the optimization problem \eqref{eq:lowerbound}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& \text{min}_P & & \gamma \\
& \text{s.t.} 
&  & (A_{j_l} A_{j_{l-1}} \dots A_{j_1} x)^T P (A_{j_l} A_{j_{l-1}} \dots A_{j_1} x) \leq \gamma^{2l} x^T P x,\,  \forall (x,j_1,\dots,j_l) \in \omega_N\\
& && P \succ 0,\ \gamma \geq 0, \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
we have:
$$\rho(\cM) \geq \frac{\gamma^{*}(\omega_N)}{\sqrt[2l]{n}}.$$ 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\epsilon >0$. By definition of $\gamma^{*}$, there exists no matrix $P \in \calS^n_{++}$ such that:
\begin{equation*}
(Ax)^T P (Ax) \leq (\gamma^*(\omega_N) -\epsilon)^{2l}x^TPx,\quad \forall x \in \R^n, \forall\, A \in \calM^{l}.
\end{equation*}
By Property \ref{rem:scaling}, this means that there exists no CQLF for the scaled set of matrices \rmj{$\frac{\cM^l}{(\gamma^*(\omega_N)-\epsilon)^l}$. Since the above inequality is true for every $\epsilon\geq 0,$ using Theorem~\ref{thm:john}, and the fact that $\rho(\cM^l)=\rho(\cM)^l,$ we conclude:
\begin{equation*}\frac{\rho(\cM)}{\gamma^*(\omega_N)} \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt[2l]{n}}.\end{equation*}}
\end{proof}
