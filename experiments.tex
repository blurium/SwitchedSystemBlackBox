We first illustrate our approach with a system in dimension $2$, with $4$ modes and JSR equal to $0.7727$. We fix $\beta = 0.92$. We look at samplings of $N:=15+50k$ points, for $k \in \{0, \dots,10\}$. After running our algorithm $10$ times and taking the average value for the lower bound, $\delta$, and the upper bound, we obtain the following plots.

We observe that $\delta$ converges to $1$, the upper-bound converges to $\rho$, the value of the JSR, and the lower-bound converges to the value of the JSR divided by $\sqrt{n}$.

We then test our algorithm with a system in dimension $4$, with $5$ modes and JSR equal to $0.7929$. We observe a slower convergence of the values, even with more points in our sampling.
[to add plots here, but they are not super nice: we do not see the convergence to $1$ of $\delta$: even after $10 000$ points, $\delta$ is below $0.85$].

Finally, we generate $10000$ cases with systems of dimension between $2$ and $7$, number of modes $m$ between $2$ and $5$, and size of samples $N$ between $30$ and $800$. We take $\beta = 0.92$ and we test if the upper bound computed is greater than the actual JSR of the system. We get $xxx$ positive tests, giving us a probability of having an upper bound equal to $xxx$.
